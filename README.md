# Logic Loom

## Description
Logic Loom is a web application that demonstrates how to set up and create an OpenAI Chat Completion with a React.js front end. The user can enter a question, and the application will display a response generated by the OpenAI Chat Completions API. For example, you might ask, "What day is it?" and receive a response like, "Friday, but you should check the calendar."
